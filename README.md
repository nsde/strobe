## Create a Tkinter Window

from strobe.gui import GUI

gui = GUI(title='Welcome to Strobe!') # Create a new window

@gui.button() # Add a new button
def say_hi(): # Keep in mind the @-Decorators are always ABOVE a function or method, and can't be used "alone"
    gui.set_title('Hi!') # Change the window's title

@gui.button(text='Close Program', color='red') # Button options
def close():
    gui.win.destroy() # You can freely configure the tkinter window and use its methods as you wish!

gui.start() # Runs the GUI program/window
# /!\ Any code under gui.start() will run after the window has been CLOSED!
```

@web.button(label='Random number (1-10)') # add a new button labelled "Random number (1-10)"
